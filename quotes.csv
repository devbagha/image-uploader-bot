quote
"An apple a day, doctor keeps away."
"You've gotta dance like there's nobody watching,Love like you'll never be hurt."
You know you're in love when you can't fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams.
A friend is someone who knows all about you and still loves you.
Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that.
We accept the love we think we deserve.
"Only once in your life, I truly believe, you find someone who can completely turn your world around."
It is better to be hated for what you are than to be loved for what you are not.
"As he read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once."
